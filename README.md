## Project Overview

The **Text-to-Code Generator** is an AI-based tool that converts natural language text into programming code using deep learning techniques. This project is built with **TensorFlow** and leverages pre-trained models to enable users to generate code snippets from text inputs.

This application can be integrated into code generation tools, IDEs, or standalone applications to assist developers in converting natural language requirements into programming code. The model uses advanced natural language processing techniques and is designed to support various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and more.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Accepts descriptive text inputs from users that specify code logic or functionality.
- **TensorFlow-Based Model**: Utilizes TensorFlow for training and running the text-to-code model.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Capable of generating code for multiple programming languages.
- **Code Generation**: Produces executable code snippets based on the input description.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Allows users to fine-tune inputs for specific code outputs (e.g., function signatures, loops, conditionals).
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use web-based interface for input and output interaction (optional).
  
## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: TensorFlow for model training and prediction.
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Streamlit for user interface.
- **Pre-Trained Models**: TensorFlow models trained on large code-text datasets (e.g., CodeParrot, CodeBERT).
  
## How It Works

1. **Input**: Users provide a natural language description of the code they need.
2. **Processing**: The input is processed by the TensorFlow-based model that understands the intent and structure of the description.
3. **Code Generation**: The model generates a code snippet that aligns with the given text description.
4. **Output**: The generated code is displayed to the user, which can be executed or further modified as needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-code-generator-using-tensorflow.git
   cd text-to-code-generator-using-tensorflow
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   For Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   For Flask:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:5000` (for Flask) or the URL provided by Streamlit. Enter the natural language description in the input box, and the system will generate the corresponding code.

### API Usage

If you wish to integrate the text-to-code generator into another application, you can make API requests to the Flask API:

- **Endpoint**: `/generate-code`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Payload**: JSON with the key `text_description` containing the description of the code.
- **Response**: JSON object containing the generated code.

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate-code -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text_description": "Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number in Python"}'
```

## Model Architecture

The model leverages a **Seq2Seq** architecture (sequence-to-sequence) that is pre-trained on code and text data:

1. **Encoder**: Encodes the natural language input into a numerical format that the model can process.
2. **Decoder**: Generates the output code sequence based on the encoded input.
3. **Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model focus on different parts of the input description while generating code.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Programming Language Support**: Add more languages, such as Java, C++, and Ruby.
- **Advanced Customization**: Allow users to specify more detailed constraints for generated code (e.g., library imports, function templates).
- **Improved Model Accuracy**: Continue to fine-tune the model for better results on complex input descriptions.
- **Auto-Complete Features**: Integrate auto-complete capabilities for partially generated code snippets.
